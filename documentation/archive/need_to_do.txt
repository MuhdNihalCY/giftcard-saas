Payouts (planned)
Payout model exists but automation is not implemented
Merchants can request payouts
Payout methods: Stripe Connect, PayPal, Bank Transfer

2. How merchants can add payment methods
Merchants cannot add their own payment gateways. Payment gateways are configured at the system level by the admin.
Current system
All merchants use the same payment gateways
Configured in environment variables by admin
No merchant-specific payment gateway settings in the database

need to fix this.

What merchants cannot do - customer should able to do.
Add their own payment gateways
Configure payment gateway credentials
Set up merchant-specific payment methods
Connect their own Stripe/PayPal accounts


this how this saas should works
Multi-tenant model (common in SaaS)
Each merchant has their own payment gateway credentials
Merchants connect their Stripe/PayPal accounts
Payments go directly to merchant accounts
Platform takes a commission
